## Full Description

Prospec AI is an internal sales intelligence platform designed to empower the sales team with up-to-date and relevant information on thousands of potential clients. By uploading a list of over 3,000 target companies, the tool automatically gathers public and third-party API data on each client, including their tech stack, recent news, and business context.

Using Azure OpenAI and the Semantic Kernel, the system analyzes client data to generate custom sales reports for each target, recommending tailored approaches, immediate sales opportunities, and long-term strategies based on Neudesic’s current products and market positioning. All generated insights, as well as the source data, are stored in CosmosDB and made accessible through a user-friendly React-based web application.

This solution enables the sales department to approach new prospects with rich, AI-driven intelligence—saving hours of manual research and increasing the chances of landing deals with more relevant, personalized outreach.
