## Full Description

The Asset Marketplace is an internal application built to centralize and make discoverable all projects, accelerators, and reusable assets across the organization. Designed as part of a new company-wide initiative, the platform enables staff to easily find available projects, see their requirements, access documentation, and connect with project ownersâ€”ultimately driving more efficient resource management and transparency.

This hybrid solution combines the strengths of Microsoft Power Platform (Dataverse for backend storage, Power Apps/Power Automate for business logic and workflows) with the flexibility and rich UI of a custom React frontend. Through extensive OData integration and custom API calls, the React application interfaces seamlessly with Dataverse, enabling dynamic interactions and a more user-friendly experience compared to traditional Power Apps canvases or pages.

The marketplace supports staff onboarding, project handoffs, and continuous knowledge sharing by consolidating all critical project and asset information in one accessible location.
