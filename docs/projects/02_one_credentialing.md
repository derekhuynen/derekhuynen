## Full Description

One Credentialing is a complex rules engine designed for the a healthcare staffing ecosystem. The system serves as the centralized authority for credentialing nurses across hundreds of partner hospitals, ensuring compliance with state, federal, and facility-specific regulations. The engine automates the validation of nurse eligibility, certification status, work-hour restrictions, and other compliance metrics to determine shift assignments.

A robust frontend admin portal allows non-technical users at a Healthcare Staffing Company to manage credentialing rules and requirements for diverse hospital partners. The solution includes comprehensive dashboards for monitoring requests, visualizing key metrics, and auditing rule enforcement. Given the sensitive and compliance-driven nature of healthcare staffing, extensive regression testing and agile development practices were central to the project’s success.
