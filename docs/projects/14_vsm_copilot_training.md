## Full Description

This project was a dual initiative for Sedgwick, a leading claims management company. The engagement began with value stream mapping of their software development lifecycle: collaborating with leadership and development teams to analyze and document current processes, gathering metrics such as lead times and cycle times to establish a productivity baseline.

Based on these insights, custom GitHub Copilot training workshops were designed and delivered to three separate teams within a single department. The workshops focused on practical Copilot usage tailored to the teams’ real workflows, challenges, and technology stack, including .NET and React. Targeted examples and prompt engineering exercises were provided, enabling developers to improve code quality, speed, and DevOps efficiency. A dashboard was set up to monitor ongoing productivity metrics and measure the long-term impact of the Copilot adoption and training.
