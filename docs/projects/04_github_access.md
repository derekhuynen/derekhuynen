## Full Description

Github Access Hub is an internal tool designed to streamline onboarding and access management for company GitHub organizations. The application allows any employee to securely log in with their company email via Azure Entra ID, view available GitHub organizations, and request access with a few clicks.

This self-service portal reduces the workload for IT and onboarding teams by automating the invitation and approval process for GitHub organizations, leveraging the GitHub GraphQL API. The solution retrieves user information, current organization memberships, and manages access requests efficiently. The entire application was architected, developed, and deployed as a solo project, with a focus on maintainability and future scalability.

The app is hosted as an Azure Static Web App, with the backend logic implemented via Azure Functions in C#. All deployments were automated using GitHub Actions, ensuring a robust CI/CD pipeline and minimal manual intervention.
