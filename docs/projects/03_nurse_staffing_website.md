## Full Description

The Nurse Staffing Website is an online platform developed for a Healthcare Staffing Company to facilitate the booking of shifts by traveling nurses. The platform supports both web and mobile users, allowing nurses to browse available hospital shifts, filter and search for specific opportunities, apply, and manage bookings—all in one place. The project was a part of a large-scale initiative, spanning multiple teams and applications, focused on modernizing healthcare staffing operations.

My team was responsible for the frontend web application, specifically the booking workflow. The website features robust filtering, complex forms, and secure booking processes. State management was a critical aspect, utilizing Redux and Redux-Sagas to ensure smooth data flows and reliable user experience. The backend, managed by another team, was built in C# with .NET, leveraging a full suite of API management tools.
