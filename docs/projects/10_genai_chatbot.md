## Full Description

GenAI ChatBot is an enterprise-grade AI chatbot developed for internal use at a Gas and Electric Company. The system ingests, chunks, and vectorizes both internal documents (claims reports, articles) and government regulatory materials. All data is indexed in Azure AI Search, enabling semantic retrieval and conversational queries with real-time citations and references.

The chatbot leverages RAG architecture to provide grounded, reliable responses by retrieving the most relevant content and combining it with generative answers from Azure OpenAI models. Staff can ask about specific regulatory changes, cross-reference policies, and verify compliance directly within the chat interface. Key features include chat history, accurate citations, and the ability to "redline" internal documents by matching them to up-to-date regulations.

The backend, built in C# with .NET and Semantic Kernel, streams responses to a modern React frontend via WebSockets for real-time interactivity. Azure Functions support additional processing, including managing pub/sub messaging and background document ingestion. Robust API management and private endpoints ensure secure access and integration across the enterprise.
