## Full Description

Neu Evaluation is an internal employee performance review system designed to streamline the review, feedback, and evaluation process across the organization. Employees can submit and view feedback on their performance in past and current projects. Managers are able to request reviews from peers, collect constructive feedback, and track the development of their team members over time. The platform allows individuals to view their profile, assess strengths and areas for improvement, and better understand the feedback they've received.

This project provided insight into the company's agile practices, DevOps processes, and standards for code reviews and collaboration. The frontend was built with React and TypeScript, styled using SaSS, and used React Hook Form for form management and validation. The application was deployed as an Azure Static Web App, with source control and project management handled through Azure DevOps and GitHub.
